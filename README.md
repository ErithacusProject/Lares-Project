# Lares-project
Lares sits on the border between life and death. A once prosperous land that led itself to the brink of extinction, in a short amount of time it has been pushed to only outposts, the remaining humans sit in the shadows of structures of places that are quickly becoming just faded stories as the years tick on, and the population continues to fall.
